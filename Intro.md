African American literature grew out of the oral tradition of
storytelling and spirituals.  In this course, you will consider these
verbal modes and their impact on the literary production of African
American authors from the Colonial period to the current day.  Along
with considering the content of literary works, you will examine the
cultural, historical, and political contexts of the literature, as well
as how the issues of gender, race, and class affect the production and
meaning of these works. In this course, you will examine the development
of African American literature in seven units: Oral Traditions; The
Literature of Slavery; Reconstruction to the  New Negro Renaissance
Movement; Harlem Renaissance; Realism, Naturalism, and Modernism; Black
Arts; and the Contemporary Period.  This course begins with a unit that
studies African American literature’s inception through oral tradition. 
This unit will teach you about the beginnings of narrative and will
ground your understanding in the development of the literary tradition.
We will also identify the principal authors and characteristics of each
of these periods and read representative texts.

### Course Information

Welcome to ENGL411.  Below, please find some general information about
the course and its requirements.  
    
 **Course Designer:** Patricia Kennedy Bostian  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials.  However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:  

-   The Annenberg Foundation's [American Passages
    series](http://www.learner.org/resources/series164.html)
-   UC College Prep’s [US History
    course](http://www.ucopenaccess.org/course/view.php?id=82)
-   [Documenting the American South](http://docsouth.unc.edu/), hosted
    by the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
Pay special attention to Unit 1 as this lays the groundwork for
understanding the more advanced, exploratory material presented in the
later units.  You will also need to complete:  

-   The Final Exam 

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam. 
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through all of the materials in the course.  
    
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment**: This course should take you a total of **116
hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists
the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These
should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a
look at these time advisories and to determine how much time you have
over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you 5 hours.  Perhaps you can
sit down with your calendar and decide to complete subunit 1.1 (a total
of 3 hours) on Monday night; subunit 1.2 (a total of 2.25 hours) on
Tuesday night; subunit 1.3 (a total of 3 hours) on Wednesday night;
etc.
