**Unit 1: Oral Traditions** <span id="1"></span> 
*African American culture has always drawn on its historical roots in
oral tradition for artistic inspiration.  Music, both sacred and
secular, has lent its rhythms equally to poetry, sermons, and fiction. 
Oral folk tales and spirituals have migration themes often referring to
Heaven, Africa, and the North.  Spirituals often have their themes
presented through biblical characters, who persevered and were delivered
assurances that they were being watched over by a guardian.  One example
of the allusion to the Bible is with the story of Exodus.  In this unit,
we will also examine the influence of spirituals and the blues, address
the use of vernacular, and explore signifying and its origin in the
folktales and storytelling on the plantation*

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 8.25 hours to complete.
