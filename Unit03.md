**Unit 3: Reconstruction to New Negro Renaissance Movement, 1865-1919**
<span id="3"></span> 
*The years after the Civil War extending to the first decade of the
twentieth century, were a period when the imperative of racial uplift
sometimes conflicted with the artist's desire to develop as an
individual.  The 1867 Reconstruction Act struck down many of the
restrictions on the lives of African Americans, but the withdrawal of
troops from the South in 1877 led the way for oppressive laws and
practices to develop.  These issues had an impact on African American
artists as they addressed the "Negro Problem:" overturning the
stereotypes of the plantation myth (Charles Chesnutt); preparing to be
American citizens (Booker T.Washington); instituting change through
political agitation (W.E.B. Du Bois);* *addressing issues of color
(James Weldon Johnson), and integrating the philosophy of racial uplift
(Anna Julia Cooper).  *
