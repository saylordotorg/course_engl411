**Unit 6: Black Arts, 1960-1975** <span id="6"></span> 
*Artists of the Black Arts movement, even while they criticized the
aesthetic aims of the movement as a whole, were moved by continuing
injustices to be politically active in their art.  Considering all
aspects of post-Civil Rights era life, they wrote scathingly of the
failings of America to create a just system—some from prison, some from
urban areas, some from within homosexual relationships.  This unit
traces a wide range of artistic and cultural ideas.  It will examine the
aesthetic that at times fought against itself with its narrow conception
of what topics could and should be addressed by African American writers
and how the African American society should be portrayed in artistic
representations.  *
