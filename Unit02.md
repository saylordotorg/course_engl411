**Unit 2: Literature of Slavery** <span id="2"></span> 
*The literature of slavery is the literature of freedom as well.  Slave
narratives were produced by former slaves and were instrumental in
documenting life on the plantations for slaves and for abolitionists to
further their cause.  This unit will explore the writings of slaves
(Wheatley) as well as the slave narratives of those who escaped their
captivity (Douglass).  In this unit, you will study the characteristics
of slave narratives and trace how those narratives influenced the genre
of slave novels. *

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 21.5 hours to complete.
