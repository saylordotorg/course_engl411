**Unit 7: Contemporary** <span id="7"></span> 
*This unit will examine the influence of American postmodernism as well
as musical trends, such hip-hop, and the embrace of nontraditional
literary genres, on contemporary African American authors.  We will
situate African American fiction in the context of social, political,
and cultural issues of the post-Civil Rights era America.  The struggles
of communities to overcome drug epidemics, HIV, and continued racism are
the focal point of many contemporary African American authors in this
unit.  The pervasive modern culture of violence and its effect on the
African American community and the literature it produces will also be
examined.*

**Unit 7 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 9.5 hours to complete.
