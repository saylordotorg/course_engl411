**Unit 5: Civil Rights Era, 1940s to 1960s** <span id="5"></span> 
*After World War II, African Americans who served their country came
home to a world that still did not accept them as equal.  The authors of
this period struggled to make a place for themselves as Americans,
seeking equality in all areas of life, yet not lose their cultural
identity.  Although African American drama begins with* *William Wells
Brown's* The Escape; Or, A Leap for Freedom*(1857), it came into its own
in the latter half of the twentieth century with Lorraine Hansberry,
Amiri Baraka, and August Wilson with its focus on issues of sexism,
racism, and classicism. *  
    
 *This unit explores both political and personal movements in drama,
poetry, and fiction, as issues of race, sex, and class converge in the
highly charged political arenas that would determine the fate of African
Americans.*
